                    Qiskit Summer Jam 2020
                </h2>
                I hosted the IBM Qiskit Summer Jam at NC State in association with the Quantum Information Club at NC State and the Duke Undergraduate Quantum Information Society. As the host of the event, I 
                organized the participants by creating and advertising the event to various campus organizations, helped facilitate team formation, and hosted the introduction and presentation portion of the event.

        originally applied to quantum
        computers as a means of universal unitary decompositionâ€“
        
        My work at Oak Ridge National Labs in the Summer of 2020 with Dr. Eugene Dumitrescu and at NC State with Dr. Lex Kemper is focused on 
        efficient gate decompositions for hamiltonian simulation. This work, currently in review and available on ArXiv, adapts algorithms 
        for universal decomposition of unitary operators
        into quantum gates in order to produce efficient circuit implementations of unitary time evolution operators for systems with a 
        certain type of Hamiltonian. The method is demonstrated in comparison to 
        Trotter based methods in optimial conditions, demonstrating that is provides a clear advantage for systems which can be modelled as 
        non-interacting fermions on a 1D lattice. Continuing work explores the applications of this method,
        which is a Cartan Decomposition of the smallest Lie Algebra which contains the vector space spanned by the operators which compose 
        the Hamiltonian, 
        
    </p>
    
    <p>The immediate follow-up to the work with Cartan Decompsition is the implementation of the algorithm in simulating the Hubbard Model and the Anderson Impurity Model using Dynamical mean Field Theory. This work is currently in progress
        </p>
    <p>The paper below, written as part of a course on the mathematics of quantum computing, focuses on algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary matrices into a quantum circuit. The paper focuses on the implementation of methods for generating circuits with few qubits, as all such algorithms have an exponential cost with system size. The methods in this paper were the motivation for my work on Cartan Decomposition</p>

                Additionally, I have worked with Dr. Harald Ade and Dr. Abay Gadisa at NC State on efficient fabrication methods for organic field effect transitors, which are electronic devices designed using organic materials such as plastics and polymers instead of traditional semi-conducting materials such as silicon. 
                Although organic electronics are not yet as effective as traditional solid-state electronics, they have key potential benefits in being easy to fabricate on a massive scale, being relatively cheap in terms of material and processing costs, being near totally transparent, and being highly flexible. These main advantages are 
                emphasised in ultrathin film devices, which are organic field effect transistors with a very thin active layer of polymer, down 1-4 layers of molecules.  However, for many materials ultrathin film devices suffer a performance cost, meaning although they are cheaper, more transparent, and more flexible than thicker devices they are 
                less desirable to research or manufacture because of the limited performance. By applying a method known as floating film transfer, we were able to realize high performance ultrathin devices using highly accessible and efficient fabrication methods.
