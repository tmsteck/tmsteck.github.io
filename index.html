                <h3 class='text-center'>Welcome!  </h3> <p>
                    My name is Thomas Steckmann, and this website is designed to host a portfolio of the research and projects I have completed 
                    with at NC State University while completing my Bachelors degrees in Physics and in Mathematics. My research if focused on 
                    developing applications which bridge the gap between developments in physics and the application of those ideas to solving
                    key problems. As of Fall 2021, I am applying for physics Ph.D. programs to focus on quantum computing, specifically 
                    on developing algorithms and applications of quantum computers to simulating important problems in condensed matter physics. 
                    For the foreseeable future, quantum computers will be      limited by constraints on the
                     capacity of the computing hardware. Thus, now and in the future, to get the most out of quantum computers and realize the 
                     research and industrial applications
                     as soon as possible, I focus on understanding and developing applications for quantum computers in physics                
                     that will minimize resource applications. This work, which is summarized in the "Quantum Computing" portion of the projects 
                     tab above, is the focus of my work at Oak Ridge National Labs in Summer 2020 and 2021, 
                     and also the Honors Capstone project I am completing at NC State with Dr. Lex Kemper at the physics department.

                Additionally, I have worked with Dr. Harald Ade and Dr. Abay Gadisa at NC State on efficient fabrication methods for organic
                 field effect transistors, which are electronic devices designed using organic materials such as plastics and polymers instead of traditional semi-conducting materials such as silicon. 
                Although organic electronics are not yet as effective as traditional solid-state electronics, they have key potential 
                benefits in being easy to fabricate on a massive scale, being relatively cheap in terms of material and processing costs, 
                being near totally transparent, and being highly flexible. These main advantages are 
                emphasized in ultrathin film devices, which are organic field effect transistors with a very thin active layer of polymer, 
                down 1-4 layers of molecules.  However, for many materials ultrathin film devices suffer a performance cost, meaning although they are cheaper, more transparent, and more flexible than thicker devices they are 
                less desirable to research or manufacture because of the limited performance. By applying a method known as floating film 
                transfer, we were able to realize high performance ultrathin devices using highly accessible and efficient fabrication methods.
